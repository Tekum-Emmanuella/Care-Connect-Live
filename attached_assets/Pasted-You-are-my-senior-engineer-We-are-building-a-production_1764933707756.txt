You are my senior engineer. We are building a production-grade software system called HealthHub Cameroon — a hybrid-cloud, offline-first telemedicine platform designed for rural clinics in Cameroon.

Follow these instructions exactly:

1. Project Purpose

Build a secure telemedicine system where:

Rural Nurses (Low tech) can record vitals offline.

Urban Specialists (High tech) can view patient records, images, diagnostics.

Admins manage permissions and data privacy.

The system MUST work offline-first and sync when internet returns.

2. Architecture Requirements

Use this exact tech stack:

Backend: Rust

Frontend: Simple HTML/JS for now

Database:

PostgreSQL (structured data)

MongoDB (unstructured medical notes, images)

Containers: Docker

Orchestration: K3s Kubernetes

Cloud: AWS Free Tier OR GCP

Messaging: RabbitMQ (for offline → online sync)

Security: OAuth2, HTTPS (OpenSSL), IAM

AI Module: Python model for vitals anomaly detection

3. What to Generate

For every request I give you, generate:

Clean, production-ready Rust code

Dockerfile + docker-compose.yaml

Database schema (PostgreSQL + MongoDB)

API routes with explanations

Edge-device offline queue logic (local storage → RabbitMQ)

Sync logic when network is restored

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) where needed

Security best practices (NO hardcoded secrets)

4. Rules & Constraints

Follow all:

Never hardcode passwords → use environment variables.

Patient names must never appear in logs.

System must run in airplane mode without crashing.

UI must support English + French.

Keep architecture modular so features can be added yearly (based on academic timeline).

Explain your file structure clearly.

5. Initial Task

Your first task:

Create the project folder structure + boilerplate Rust backend + Docker configuration + README explaining how to run the system locally.

Make sure the rust backend includes:

POST /patient/create

GET /patient/:id

POST /sync endpoint

Local queue handling (in-memory for now)

6. Output Format

Always return:

Code blocks for each file

Explanations

Commands to run

Notes about security and scalability
